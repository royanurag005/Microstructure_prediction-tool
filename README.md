## About the App

This app leverages Google's Gemini Pro Vision API to perform an in-depth analysis of microstructures captured in uploaded images. It identifies and characterizes phases such as ferrite, cementite, martensite, and spheroidal graphite flakes. Additionally, the app provides insights into the composition, distribution, and mechanical properties of each identified phase.

## How to Use

1. **Input Prompt:**
   - Enter a prompt describing the analysis you want to perform.

2. **Upload an Image:**
   - Choose an image file (in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format) containing the microstructure to be analyzed.

3. **Predict:**
   - Click the 'Predict' button to initiate the analysis.
